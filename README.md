# ESPN Fantasy Decruftifier
*Extensions for Chrome and Firefox*

Improves the ESPN Fantasy GUI by removing unnecessary elements and tightening up margins, padding, and heights.

Note that this is fragile and frequently breaks due to changes on ESPN.  It is also a hobby project.  See the GitHub page for support and an issue log.

After installing, the ESPN Fantasy Baseball site, especially player lists, should appear different and better.

The extension can be installed from [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/espn-fantasy-decruftifier/kejjliglnpbajhahgieahppocjmgbhjh]
